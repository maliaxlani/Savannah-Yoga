                <p> Yoga comes into people's lives for many differenet reasons. Some may seek it as a rebalance and release of stagnant energy, others may find it a more spiritual practice, turning these breathe linked Vinyas's into a moving meditation. While some even migrate towards yoga to reap the benefits of strength flexbility and clarity this practice brings. Your reasons can be some, none or all of these. Regardless of the reasons you feel drawn to yoga, I will tailor a private lesson to your personal needs, as we work towards growth within our practice, while staying mindful and grateful to the present moment of both our minds and bodies. Below are the rates for these specialized private lessons, in US currency.</p>
