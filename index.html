            <h2>My Journey</h2>

            <div>
                <h3>How it all began...</h3>
                <p> At the age of 21 I started dabbling within yoga, as both a physical and mental release in the midst of a chaotic part within my beginning adulthood. This time on my mat gave me an emotional rebalance, as I honed my awareness inward by linking breath to movement, I learned to let the outside world fade away. Soon I realized I felt frazzled, out of balance without a consistent practice of these beloved postures. These sequences pushed my growth in strength, flexibility, and most importantly a never ending inward journey of self discovery. This journey has led me to an awakening 200 hour vinyasa teacher traning course in January 2018, led by one of the most spiritually welathy teachers I was lucky enough to learn from, Tamal Dodge. After a short six months of teaching, I continued my learning while traveling in northern Indea by completing a 300 hour yoga teacher training. I had the oppurtunity to dive deeper into myself as I learned more about the beautiful practice of vinyasa yoga, including the history behind it.</p>

                <h3>The Intention:</h3>
                <p> It is important to realize we all have our own paths to follow. I am forever blooming and will always first consider myself a student and secondly a teacher within vinyasa styled yoga. I know few will have the time to travel and experience yoga teacher trainings at the level I have been blessed to experience, this is why I wish to share the knowledge I've accumulated and grown from, with those who are willing to leave their minds open. </p>
            </div>

            <div>

                <p>I also believe in living life as an open book, sharing everything I have with those who are willing to listen. I try not to shy away from all the different levels of myself. I would love for you to check out the contact page and get in touch. I have linked my personal Instagram to show I am not just a yogi, I am human and believe in the growing through human connection. There is not one type of "yogi" and I truly believe yoga can be for everyone. We all wear many different hats which we hold close to our identity, but we are not these labels, take the time to melt away these identities and come join me on a mat, leaving our hats at the door.</p>
