          <p> I've found that stepping outside of your comfort zone into foreign land tends to allow people to break down their walls, shedding the layers our society has built up for us. Connection is often times more genuine when we take the time to step away from the identity we hold onto in our day to day lives. <br>Traveling has become a huge part of my life, soon I will share the love of discovery, adventure and yoga on an organized retreat.
